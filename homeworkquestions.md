# Questions

- [ ] Why Can't I call the setName function from the stepper component?
  - This should set the name in App state from the inputs in the name component.
  - I am passing in an UpdateAppState function from the name compent, this is so I can update the state that has been set in parent compent to the stepper.
  - The parameters appear to be passed in ok, as I can log these in the function back in App, but it wont update the app state.
  - The exact same function does work from the name component, as demoed using the update button.
